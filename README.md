# Analysis of Pokemon data
Analysis of Pokemon data reveals a variety of important insights into their characteristics and attribute distribution. I used the dataset from the link: http://bit.ly/data-pokemon-dsf. This project aims to analyze a Pokemon dataset, which includes various important attributes such as the name, type and basic statistics of each Pokemon. This analysis was conducted to gain in-depth insight into the distribution of Pokemon types, their statistical characteristics, and the comparison between legendary and non-legendary Pokemon. 

## Dataset
The dataset used contains the following attributes:
1. Name: The name of the Pokemon
2. Type 1: The main type of Pokemon
3. Type 2: Second type of Pokemon (if any)
4. Total: The total sum of all the Pokemon's base stats
5. HP: The Pokemon's number of health points
6. Attack: The power of a Pokemon's physical attack
7. Defense: The Pokemon's physical defense
8. Sp. Atk: A Pokemon's special attack power
9. Sp. Def: Pokemon's special defense
10. Speed: The Pokemon's speed
11. Generation: The generation in which Pokemon were first introduced
12. Legendary: Indicator of whether a Pokemon is legendary (True/False)

## Analysis Performed 
1. Pokemon Type Distribution: Visualization of the distribution of primary types (Type 1) and secondary types (Type 2) to understand how often each type appears in the dataset.
2. Basic Statistical Distribution: Analysis and visualization of the distribution of the attributes 'HP', 'Attack', 'Defense', 'Sp. Atk', 'Sp. Def', and 'Speed' to identify patterns and outliers.
3. Correlation Between Attributes: Calculate and analyze the correlation between various attributes to understand the relationship between Pokemon's basic statistics.
4. Comparison of Legendary and Non-Legendary Pokemon: Comparing the average values ​​of the attributes 'HP', 'Attack', 'Defense', 'Sp. Atk', 'Sp. Def', and 'Speed' between legendary and non-legendary Pokemon to identify the legendary Pokemon's statistical advantage.

## Key Findings
1. Type Distribution: Water types are the most common Pokemon types, while types like Ice and Dragon are relatively rare.
2. Base Stats: Most Pokemon have health and defense values ​​in the mid to low range, while physical and special attack attributes show nearly similar distributions.
3. Correlation: There is a significant positive correlation between 'Attack' and 'Sp. Atk', as well as between 'Defense' and 'Sp. Def'.
4. Legendary and Non-Legendary Comparison: Legendary Pokemon have higher average scores across all attributes, indicating that they are more powerful and versatile.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides deep insight into the Pokemon's characteristics and relative strengths. These findings can be used to understand design and balance in games, as well as to design more effective combat strategies.
